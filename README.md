# HTML-CSS-BASIC-SAMPLE-PROYECT
This project demonstrates the basic skills of HTML and CSS. It contains menus, tables, pictures, audio and video, and many other basic HTML and CSS skills. 

GTA # stands for "Guia de trabajo" or work guide. The project collects different guides that I have made throughout the semester, that's why it is divided in several "GTA's".

PLEASE use "Page 8 (IndexMenuPrincipal).html" to access the main page of the project and see all the different guides in order.
